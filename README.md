# Customer-Chrun-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data using SQL. The goal was to identify trends, patterns, and drivers of churn that could inform business retention strategies.

**What I Did**

Queried a relational database with multiple tables (customers, subscriptions, transactions).

Performed data cleaning and validation to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Created aggregate metrics (churn rates by tenure, region, and subscription type).

Identified key customer segments with high churn risk.

Recommended actionable insights for improving retention.

 **What I Learned**

How to structure SQL queries for data exploration and business insights.

Importance of validating and reviewing data quality before analysis.

Translating raw query results into clear business recommendations.

Reinforced the connection between SQL outputs and business decision-making.

**Skills Used** 

SQL: SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, CASE WHEN, subqueries

Data Analysis: churn calculations, KPI definitions

Business Analytics: identifying churn drivers, proposing retention strategies

Data Quality: ensuring accurate results before reporting

**Results**
Customers with shorter tenure and basic subscription plans showed higher churn rates.

Retention efforts should prioritize new customers within their first 90 days.

Upselling premium plans could help reduce churn long-term.
